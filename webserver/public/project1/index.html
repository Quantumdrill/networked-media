    <h1>You are now leaving for school, try to arrive at the classroom on time</h1>
    <p>This interactive narration is based on my experience of traveling to 370 Jay St before every class. Usually I take the A or C train from Fulton St Station in downtown Manhattan, and arrive at Jay St Metro Tech Station after two stops, with a duration of 5 min. However this doesn't always go as planned, the elevator might be packed, trains might be delayed or cancelled etc. With your decisions in different situations there will be different outcomes in the end of this game.</p>
